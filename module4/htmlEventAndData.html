    <h1>Understanding Event and Data Attributes</h1>
    <h2>Event Attributes</h2>

    <p>Event attribute are used to <b>define how to HTML elements should respond to user interactions</b>, such as mouse
        click or keyboard input. When an event is triggered, it executes a specified function or script.</p>

    <p>Some of the most commonly used event attributes include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><mark>onclick</mark> - executes a script when the element is clicked,</li>
        <li><mark>onmouseover</mark> - executes a script when the mouse pointer moves over the element,</li>
        <li><mark>onmouseout</mark> - executes a script when the mouse pointer moves out of the element,</li>
        <li><mark>onkeydown</mark> - executes a script when a keyboard key is pressed down,</li>
        <li><mark>onkeyup</mark> - executes a script when a keyboard key is released. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>For instance, using <mark>onclick</mark>, you can make a button show a message when clicked:</p>
    <button onclick="alert('hello world!')">click me</button>
    <p>In this example, clicking the button <b>triggers an alert box</b> with "hello world" this simple interaction is
        achieved without needing in-depth JavaScript knowledge.</p>

    <h2>Data Attributes</h2>
    <p>Data attributes are used to <b>store extra information about HTML element that is not displayed to the user</b>
    </p>
    <p>This information can be used for scripting or styling purposes (you can store information such IDs, values, or
        other data that may be useful in web development), and can be accessed and manipulated via JavaScript or CSS.
    </p>
    <p>You start these attributes with <mark>data-</mark> and add a name that makes sense for what you're storing, like
        <mark>data-recepe-id</mark> for unique recipe number
    </p>

    <p>Imagine a cooking website where users can save recipes. You can use data attributes to keep each recipe's unique
        ID right in the HTML.</p>

    <ul>
        <li data-recipe-id="001">
            <h2>Spaghetti with Meatballs</h2>
            <p>A classic Italian dish that's perfect for a cozy night in.</p>
            <button class="save-recipe">Save Recipe</button>
        </li>
        <li data-recipe-id="002">
            <h2>Chicken Tikka Masala</h2>
            <p>A flavorful Indian curry that's sure to please.</p>
            <button class="save-recipe">Save Recipe</button>
        </li>
        <li data-recipe-id="003">
            <h2>Beef and Broccoli Stir Fry</h2>
            <p>A quick and easy weeknight dinner that's packed with flavor.</p>
            <button class="save-recipe">Save Recipe</button>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In this example, each recipe is represented by an <mark>li</mark> element with a <mark>data-recipe-id</mark>
        attribute that stores the unique ID of the recipe. When the user clicks the "Save Recipe" button, a JavaScript
        function could be called that retrieves the recipe ID from the data attribute and sends it to your backend API
        in order to add it to the user's recipe box.</p>

    <p>The possibilities are endless, and data attributes can be used in many different ways to add functionality and
        customization to your website.</p>
