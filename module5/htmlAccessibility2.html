    <h1>Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)</h1>
    <p>
        ARIA is a powerful <b>set of attributes that you can add to HTML elements</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        ARIA enhances the accessibility of dynamic and interactive content by <b>providing additional information to
            assistive technologies</b>, like screen readers. It ensures that users with disabilities can effectively
        navigate and interact with your web applications.
    </p>

    <h2>ARIA Roles</h2>
    <p>
        One of the key components of ARIA is the concept of <b>roles</b>. Roles define <b>the type and purpose of an
            element</b>, helping assistive technologies understand its function.
    </p>
    <p>
        For instance, you can use the <mark>role</mark> attribute to indicate wheter and element is a button, link,
        heading, or any other interactive element. This way, screen readers can accurately convey the purpose of the
        element to users.
    </p>

    <textarea readonly style="height: 60px;">
<button role="button">Click me</button>
<a href="#" role="link">Read more</a>
<h2 role="heading">Important Information</h2></textarea>
    <p>These roles help assistive technologies understand the intended purpose of each elements, enhancing the
        accessibility of the content.</p>

    <h2>ARIA States and Properties.</h2>
    <p>
        In addition to roles, ARIA includes <b>states and properties</b> that further describe the behavior of elements.
        States describe <b>the current condition of an element</b>, while properties <b>provide additional information
            about an element's characteristics</b> </p>
    <p>
        For example, you can use ARIA attributes like <mark>aria-expanded</mark>, <mark>aria-checked</mark>, and
        <mark>aria-hidden</mark> to communicate whether a menu is open or closed, a checkbox is checked or unchecked, or
        an element is hidden from screen readers, respectively:
    </p>

    <textarea style="height: 70px;" readonly>
<button aria-expanded="true">Toggle menu</button>
<input type="checkbox" aria-checked="false">
<div aria-hidden="true">This content is hidden from screen readers</div>
    </textarea>

    <p><b>Result of the code before</b> </p>
    <button aria-expanded="true">Toggle menu</button>
    <input type="checkbox" aria-checked="false">
    <div aria-hidden="true">This content is hidden from screen readers</div>
    <p>In this example, the <mark>button</mark> elements uses <mark>aria-expanded</mark> to indicate that the menu is
        currently open, the <mark>input</mark> element uses <mark>aria-checked</mark> to indicate that the checkbox is
        unchecked, and the <mark>div</mark> elements uses <mark>aria-hidden</mark> to hide its content from screen
        readers. These ARIA attributes enhance the accessibility and understanding of the elements for users of
        assistive technologies</p>
    <p>Again, to ensure you ARIA implementations are effective, it's important to test your web application with screen
        readers and other assistive technologies. This will help you verify that the added ARIA roles, states, and
        properties are accurately conveyed to users with disabilities.</p>


    <h2>Testing Accessibility</h2>
    <p>
        Testing your website for accessibility helps you <b>identify potential issues and make necessary
            improvements</b>. Here's what you can do:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Use <b>built-in accessibility tools</b> to identify potential accessibility issues. Most modern web browsers
            have built-in accessibility tool kits, for example: <ul>
                <li><em>Chrome Accessibility DevTools</em>: In Google Chrome, open your website, right-click on an
                    element, and select "Inspect". Go to the "Accessibility" tab in DevTools panel to see a list of
                    accessibility issues.
                </li>
                <li><em>Firefox Accessibility Inspector</em>: In Mozilla Firefox, right-click on an element and select
                    "Inspect element". Go to the "Accessibility" tab in the inspector panel to view accessibility
                    information and issues.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Validate HTML with W3C Validator</b> - use the <ins style="color: #7df9ff;">W3C HTML Validators</ins>
            to check your HTML code for any syntax erros or structural issues that might affect accessibility. Valid
            HTML ensures that your website is well structured and follows best practices.</li>
        <li><b>Test with screen readers</b> - This can help you understand how users with disabilities experience your
            content. You can use a free reader:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>NVDA</li>
            <li>VoiceOver</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Check keyboard navigation</b> to ensure that your website can be navigated using only a keyboard. Use the
            "tab" key to navigate through interactive elements, links, and forms. Ensure focus indicators are visible
            and elements can be activated using the "Enter" key.</li>
        <li><b>Use color contrast checkers</b>, such as the one provide by <ins style="color: #7df9ff;">WebAIM</ins>
        </li>
        <li>Finally, <b>test with real users</b> - conduct <ins style="color: #7da9ff">Usability testing</ins></li>
    </ol>
