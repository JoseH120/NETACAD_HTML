    <h1>What is web accessibility?</h1>
    <p>
        Web accessibility ensures that <b>people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with
            your website just like anyone else.</b>
    </p>

    <h2>Why is web accessibility important?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Inclusivity</b> - one of the main reasons for web accessibility is to ensure that your website is
            inclusive and caters to a diverge range of users. When you crate an accessible website, you're making it
            possible for everyone, regardless of their abilities, to access and enjoy your content.</li>
        <li><b>Legal and ethical responsibility</b> - many countries have laws and regulations that require websites to
            be accessible. By adhering to these guidelines, you're not only fulfilling your legal obligations but also
            demonstrating commitment to ethical principles and social responsibility. Examples of such laws are the <ins
                style="color:#7df9ff">ADA</ins> - The Americans with Disabilities Act in the USA, and the <ins
                style="color:#7df9ff">EAA</ins> - The European Accessibility Act in Europe</li>
        <li><b>Expanded audience</b> - designing with accessibility in mind means reaching a wider audience. People with
            disabilities are a significant portion of the population, and by accommodating their needs, you're tapping
            into a valuable demographic.</li>
        <li><b>Improved SEO</b> - many accessibility practices align with search engine optimization (SEO) best
            practices. Properly structured content, descriptive headings, and meaningful image alt text can boost your
            website's search engine ranking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</h1>
    <p>
        The WCAG are a set of <b>internationally recognized guidelines for making web content more accessible</b>.
        <br>
        They provide a framework for creating web content that can be understood, navigated, and interacted with by
        everyone, regardless of their abilities or types/specificities of devices used to access content.
        <br>
        The main principles of WCAG are <b>perceivable, operable, undestanble, and robust</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The WCAG guidelines are organized into three levels of conformance: A, AA, and AAA. <br> Each level has specific
        success criteria that your website should meet to ensure accessibility (i.e. it indicates the degree to which
        your website meets accessibility standards)
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li><b>Level A</b> - focuses on the most fundamental accessibility requirements. It's a great starting point and
            ensures that your website can be used by a broader audience.</li>
        <li><b>Level AA</b> - meeting Level AA criteria enhances accessibility even further. It includes guidelines for
            more complex interactions and content, making your website accessible to a wider range of users.</li>
        <li><b>Level AAA</b> - the highets level of conformance and includes guidelines that address the most intricate
            accessibility issues. Meeting Level AAA criteria provides the most inclusive experience for users.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Applying WCAG</h3>
    <p>
        Is a step-by-step process that involves understanding the guidelines, assessing your website's accessibility,
        and implementing necessary changes. Let's break down the process into simple steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Familiarize yourself with WCAG</b> - start by studying the WCAG guidelines.</li>
        <li><b>Conformance levels</b> - decide on the conformance level you want to achieve: A, AA, or AAA. Level AA is
            often recommended as it covers a broad range of accessibility issues</li>
        <li>b{Website Evaluation}: <ul>
                <li>Manual evaluation - review your website's content design, and functionality manually to identify
                    potential accessibility barriers</li>
                <li>Automated tools - use automated <ins>accessibility testing tools</ins> to scan your website for
                    issues. Keep in mind that automated tools catch many issues but not all.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Identify accessibility issues</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Perceivable</b> - check for proper alternative text for images, captions for multimedia, and
                    appropriate headings for content structure</li>
                <li><b>Operable</b> - ensure keyboard navigation, focus indicators, and proper form labels. Verify that
                    users can interact with all elements without limitations.</li>
                <li><b>Understanble</b> - use clear and simple language provide instructions, and avoid complex
                    navigation structures.</li>
                <li><b>Robust</b> - ensure compatibility with various assistive technologies and web browsers.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Make necessary changes / Apply Strategies to create accessible content:</b></li>
        <li><b>Readable text</b> - Use legible font sizes and fonts that are easy to read. Avoid using small text thay
            may be difficult for users with visual impairments to read.</li>
        <li><b>Color contrast</b> - Adjust text and background colors to meet contrast ratios and ensure readability,
            especially for user with visual impairments.</li>
        <li><b>Keyboard navigation</b> - ensure all interactive elements, such as buttons, links, and forms fields, can
            be accessed and used with a keyboard. This is crucial for users who cannot use a mouse. Ensure that focus
            indicators are visible and clearly distinguishable when navigating through your website using a keyboard.
            This helps users understand where their focus is on the page.</li>
        <li><b>Headings and semantics elements</b> - use proper HTML elments like headings (h1 - h6), lists, and
            semantic tags(e.g. nav, main, section, and article) to structure your content. This helps screen readers
            understand the organization of your webpage.</li>
        <li><b>Alternative text</b> - provide descriptive alternative text for images and non-text content using the
            <em>alt</em> attribute.
        </li>
        <li><b>Forms and labels</b> - ensure form fields have clear labels and provide error messages</li>
        <li><b>Descriptive links</b> - write meaningful and descriptive link text instead of generic phrases like "click
            me" or "read more". This helps user understand the purpose of the link without relying solely on context.
        </li>
        <li><b>video and audio</b> - add captions and transcript for multimedia content. Also, include transcript for
            multimedia, making the content accessible to users who are deaf or hard of hearing. Avoid auto-playing audio
            or video content, as it can be disruptive and disorienting for users who rely on screen readers.</li>
        <li><b>Accesible forms</b> - ensure form fields have clear and concise labels. Use HTML attributes like
            <mark>aria-label</mark> and <mark>aria-labelledby</mark> to provide addtional context to assistive
            technologies.
        </li>
        <li><b>Use ARIA roles</b> - use ARIA (Accesible Rich Internet Applications) roles and attributes to enhance the
            accessibility of dynamic and interactive content, such as buttons, sliders, tabs, and modals.</li>
        <li><b>Test and verify</b>:
            <ul>
                <li><b>User testing - involve users with disabilities in testing</b> your website for accessibility.
                    They can provide valuable feedback on the user experience.</li>
                <li><b>Manual testing</b> - go through each success criterion and ensure they are implemented correctly.
                </li>
                <li><b>Automated testing</b> - use automated tools to catch any remaining issues.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Regular maintenance</b> - continously monitor and update your website's accessibility as you add new
            content or make changes. Stay informed about updates to WCAG guidelines and best practices.</li>
    </ol>
