    <h1>HTML Best Practices</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Use semanctic HTML</b> - choose the appropriate HTML tags that accurately describes the content they
            enclose.</li>
        <li><b>Maintain consistent indentation and formatting</b> throughout your code. Properly indented code enhances
            readability (great minds say that code is read more often than written) and makes it easier to identify the
            structure of your HTML elements.</li>
        <li>Whenever possible, <b>avoid deprectad tag</b> like <mark>&lt;center&gt;</mark>, <mark>&lt;font&gt;</mark>,
            and <mark>&lt;strike&gt;</mark>. Instead, use CSS for styling and layout, and use appropriate HTML tags.
            Similarly, <b>avoid deprecated attributes</b> such as <mark>frame</mark></li>
        <li><b>Use lowercase tags and attribute</b></li>
        <li>Use descriptive <b>comments</b> in you HTML code to explain complex sections, structures, or special
            considerations. Comments are helpful for othe developers (and your future self)</li>
        <li><b>Optimize Images</b> - provide descriptive alternative text using the alt attribute for better
            accessibility. Additionally, optimize image file sizes to improve page loading times</li>
        <li><b>Keep styles separate</b> - avoid inline styles within your HTML elements. Instead, use internal CSS
            styles or external CSS files (recommended - we'll learn more about this in the second course from this
            series) to keep styling separate from your HTML content. This approach promotes maintainability and allows
            for consistent design accross multiple pages.</li>
        <li><b>Minimize use of <mark>&lt;br&gt;</mark> tags</b> - Use CSS for controlling line spacing and layout,
            instead of relying heavily on the <mark>&lt;br&gt;</mark> tag for line breaks. Overusing it can lead to poor
            code structure and hinder maintainability</li>
        <li><b>Ensure your HTML code is valid</b> by adhering to the HTML specifications and using proper nesting,
            opening, and closing tags. You can use online HTML validation tools to check your code's validity</li>
        <li><b>Followe the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG</b> to make your web content accessibility to users
            with disabilities. Use semantic HTML, provide meaningful alt text for images, and ensure keyboard navigation
            works properly.</li>
        <li><b>Test your HTML code on multiple browsers</b> to ensure consistent functionality and appearance. Different
            browsers might interpret HTML tags and styles differently.</li>
        <li><b>Validate cross-device compatibility</b> - test your website on different devices, screen sizes, and
            resolutions to ensure responsive design and cross-browser compatibility</li>
        <li><b>Use meaningful IDs and class names</b> - when assigning IDs and class names to elements, choose
            descriptive names that convey bv </li>
        <li><b>Specify the character enconding</b> for you HTML documents using the <mark>&lt;meta
                charset="utf-8"&gt;</mark> tag to ensure proper rendering of special characters and symbols.</li>
        <li>Last but not least - <b>regularly update your knowledge</b>. Web technologies evolve rapidly. Kepp learning
            and staying update with the latest HTML specifications, best practices, and techniques to maintain the
            quality of your web projects.</li>
