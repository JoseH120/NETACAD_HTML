    <h1>Microformats, Microdata, and Schema.org</h1>
    <p>
        When we build a website, we often want search engines line Google to be able to understand what our website is
        about so that they can show it to people who are looking for that information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Microdata and microformats are two ways of <b>adding extra information to your website in a structured way so
            that search engines can easily understand it</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        for example, let's say we have a recipe website. we can use microdata or microformats to add structured data to
        our recipe pages such as the name of the recipe, the ingredients, and the cooking time. <br>This makes it easier
        for search engines to recognize that the page is about a recipe and show it to people who are searching for that
        recipe.
    </p>

    <h2>Microformats.</h2>
    <p>
        microformatsu use a specific class naming convention to <b>define data within HTML elements.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, <em>hCard</em> is a microformat used to describe a person or organization and their contact
        information. It is based on the vCard format, which is a standardized format for electronic business cards that
        is used for exchangin contact information between different applications and platforms
    </p>
    <p>
        To implement <em>hCard</em>, you would add class names to specific HTML elements to indicate what information is
        contained within them. <b>Search engines can then extract this information and display it in search results.</b>
    </p>
    <p><b>For example look the code below</b>:</p>
    <textarea style="height:185px" cols="50" readonly>
<div class="vCard">
    <p class="fn">John Smith</p>
    <p class="title">Web Developer</p>
    <p class="org">Smith Web Solutions</p>
    <p class="tel">555-555-5555</p>
    <a href="mailto:john@smithwebsolutions.com" class="email">john@smithwebsolutions.com</a>
    <p class="adr">
        <span class="street-address">123 Main St.</span>
        <span class="locality">Anytown</span>, <span class="region">CA</span> <span class="postal-code">12345</span>
    </p>
</div>
    </textarea>
    <p><b>Result of the code below</b>.</p>
    <div class="vCard">
        <p class="fn">John Smith</p>
        <p class="title">Web Developer</p>
        <p class="org">Smith Web Solutions</p>
        <p class="tel">555-555-5555</p>
        <a href="mailto:john@smithwebsolutions.com" class="email">john@smithwebsolutions.com</a>
        <p class="adr">
            <span class="street-address">123 Main St.</span>
            <span class="locality">Anytown</span>, <span class="region">CA</span> <span class="postal-code">12345</span>
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Microdata and Schema.org</h2>
    <p>
        Microdata, on the other hand, <b>uses HTML attributes to associate data with specific elements.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        The most commonly used attribute for microdata is the <mark>itemprop</mark> attribute, which defines the type of
        data contained within an HTML element. For example, if you have a page with a review of a product, you could use
        the <mark>itemprop</mark> attribute to indicate the name of the product, the author of the review, and the
        rating given.
    </p>
    <p>
        <ins style="color:blue">Schema.org</ins> is a <b>specific vocabulary of microdata</b> that was developed by
        Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and other search engines to standardize the way structured data is added to web pages.
        By using <em>Schema.org</em>, you can provide even more detailed information to search engines about your
        content, such as the author, the publisher, and the date published.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            Here's an example of using microdata to add schema.org structured data to a web page:
        </b>
    </p>

    <textarea style="height: 120px;" readonly>
<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">
    <h2 itemprop="name">John Smith</h2>
    <p itemprop="jobTitle">Web developer</p>

    </p>
</div></textarea>
    <p><b>Result of the code above</b></p>
    <div>
        <h2 itemprop="name">John Smith</h2>
        <p itemprop="jobTitle">Web developer</p>
        <p>
