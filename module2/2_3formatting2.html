    <h2>2.3.1 Quotations. the q and blockquote tags</h2>
    <h3>the q tag</h3>
    <p><q>The only way to do great work is to love what you do.</q> - Steve Jobs</p>

    <h2>The blockquote tag</h2>
    <p>As Albert Einstein once said:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>"Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world. The
            true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This quote speaks to the idea that creativity and original thinking are more important than simply accumulating
        knowledge. It suggests that being able to see beyond what is already known and to imagine new possibilities is a
        key characteristic of intelligence.</p>

    <h2>2.3.2 the cite tag</h2>
    <p>I recently read <cite>The great gatsby</cite> by F. Scott Fitzgerald.</p>

    <h2>2.3.3 The cite attribute.</h2>
    <p>As Steve jobs once said, <q cite="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/steve_jobs_416096">Innovattion
            distinguishes a leader and a follower</q></p>

    <p>The cite attribute typically doesn't have a visible effect in a web browser, but it can be used by
        screen readers to provide additional context.</p>

    <h2>2.3.4 The footer tag</h2>
    <p>another way to provide more contxt for a quotations is to use the footer tag, which is a semantic tag that helps
        search engines and screen readers understand the content of the page.</p>
    
        <blockquote>
            <p>The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.</p>
            <footer>- Dr. Seuss</footer>
