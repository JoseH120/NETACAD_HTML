    <h1>HTML Graphics</h1>
    <h2>Understanding HTML Graphics</h2>

    <p>they help bring your web pages to life with colors, shapes, and animations. In HTML, there are two widely used
        methods for creating graphics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The <b>canvas</b> element, which allows you to draw and animate 2D shapes and images directly through
            JavaScript, and</li>
        <li><b>Scalable Vector Graphics</b> (SVG), a way to include high-quality graphics that can be scale to any size
            without losing clarity, perfect for logos, icons, and complex illustrations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Canvas</h2>
    <p>Canvas enables you to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create lines, shapes and images.</li>
        <li>Develop animations and interactive elements.</li>
        <li>Implement games and dynamic visual effects.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While you can create the <mark>canvas</mark> element in HTML, you need JavaScript to make it perform meaningful
        actions (drawing on a canvas in HTML involves using the <ins>canvas API</ins>, a set of tools for drawing
        shapes, lines, images, text, and more on the canvas) </p>
    <p>Therefore, at this stage, we're merely introducing the concept of canvas, with more in-depth exploration coming
        up when we delve into JavaScript.</p>
    <p>For now, let's look at a basic example:</p>
        
    <canvas id="mycanvas" width="300" height="200"></canvas>

    <h2></h2>

    <script>
        const canvas = document.getElementById('mycanvas');
        const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

        ctx.fillStyle = "red";
        ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 200, 100);
    </script>
