    <h1>HTML APIs</h1>

    <h2>Understanding HTMLApis</h2>

    <p>
        An HTML API, or <b>Application Programming Interface</b>, is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allows
        different software <b>components, application, or system to interact and communicate with each other</b>
    </p>

    <h2>Geolocation API</h2>
    <p><strong>retrieve the geographic location</strong></p>

    <p>Let's take a look at an example code that utilizes the Geolocation API to fetch user's current coordinates and
        display them on the webpage:</p>


    <button id="getLocation">Get Location</button>

    <p id="result"></p>

    <h2>Audio and video APIs</h2>
    <p>
        These elements come with their own APIs that allow you to <b>control payback, volume, and other features</b>
        They are great for embedding music, videos, popcasts, or other multimedia elements without relying on external
        pulgins.
    </p>

    <audio controls>
        <source src="../media/mp3/dragonball.mp3">
        <p>You browser does not support the audio element.</p>
    </audio>

    <h2>Web Storage API</h2>
    <p>
        The Web Storage API lets websites save data directly on your device. This is super helpful for web applications
        that want to keep track of your settings, like your preferred language or theme, save data for later, or let you
        use their features even when you're not online.
    </p>
    <p>There are two main types of storage:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Session Storage</b>, which is like a temporary memory for your website visit. It remembers things while
            your browser is open, but once your</li>
        <li><b>Local Storage</b>, which u can think of as a more permanent memory. It keeps data even after you closed
            and reopen your browser. This is a great for saving preferences that make your visits more personal and
            convenient.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These work similarly to <em>cookies</em> but are more intuitives</p>

    <h2>Notifications API</h2>
    <p>is like messenger that <b>allows your website to send messages(notifications) to users</b>, even if they're not
        currently looking at your site.</p>

    <h2>Canvas API</h2>
    <p>is like a digital art studio for your website. It gives you the tools to draw, animate, and create interactive
        graphics right in the browser with javascript. This is fantastic for adding visual flair to your site, wheter
        it's simple drawing , complex animations, or interactive games.</p>

        const getLocationButton = document.getElementById("getLocation");
        const resultElement = document.getElementById("result");
        getLocationButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
            if ("geolocation" in navigator) {
                navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((position) => {
                    const latitude = position.coords.latitude;
                    const longitude = position.coords.longitude;
                    resultElement.textContent = `Latitude: ${latitude}, Longitude: ${longitude}`;
                })
            } else {
                resultElement.textContent = "Gelolocation is ot supported by your browser";
            }
        })

        // Save the theme to local storage.
        localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');

        // Retrieve the theme when the user comes back
        const userTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme')
        document.body.classList.add(userTheme); // "dark" theme
